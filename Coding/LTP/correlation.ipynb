        "- the calcium concentration in spines was experimentally shown to be a correlation sensitive signal. NMDA receptors are a candidate mediator for the correlation dependent calcium signal\r\n",

Short, weak level activate one subunit and deactivate after the level drops; higher level an active subunit can phosphorylate the neiboring subunit and remain active. At resting calcium level, PP1 can dephosphorylate an active subunit but a neighboring active site can immediately rephosphorylate it again. \r\n",
